        <h1>FitMate Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>At FitMate - Dynamic Health ("the App"), we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your information.</p>

        <h2>1. HealthKit Data</h2>
        <p>FitMate uses Apple's HealthKit framework to access your health and fitness data (such as step count and environmental noise exposure). We follow these strict rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Storage:</strong> We do not store your HealthKit data on our servers. All health data is processed locally on your device to animate the Dynamic Island characters.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The data is used solely to provide health and fitness tracking features and to animate your virtual companion.</li>
            <li><strong>No Advertising:</strong> We will never use your HealthKit data for advertising or similar services.</li>
            <li><strong>No Sharing:</strong> We do not share your health data with any third parties without your explicit consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Information Collection & Use</h2>
        <p>We do not collect or store personal identifiers like your name or email address. We may collect anonymous technical data (e.g., device model, OS version) to ensure the Dynamic Island and Live Activities function correctly across all devices.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use industry-standard services to support our App's functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used to manage subscriptions and unlock premium characters. All payments are handled securely by Apple via the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Used for anonymous crash reporting and basic analytics to improve the app's stability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We prioritize the security of your information. Since your most sensitive data (HealthKit) stays on your device or in your private iCloud, it is protected by Apple's robust security systems.</p>

        <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at:</p>
