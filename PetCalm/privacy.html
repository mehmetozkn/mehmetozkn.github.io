    <h1>PetCalm Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>At <strong>PetCalm</strong> ("the App"), we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data, with a specific focus on your audio data and voice recordings.</p>

    <h2>1. Microphone Usage & Audio Privacy</h2>
    <p>The core functionality of the App requires access to your device's microphone to detect your pet's sounds (e.g., barking). We value your privacy and adhere to a strict <span class="highlight">"On-Device Processing"</span> policy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Analysis:</strong> The microphone is used solely to listen for specific sound patterns in real-time. This processing happens entirely on your device using Apple's SoundAnalysis framework or similar on-device technologies.</li>
        <li><strong>No Cloud Uploads:</strong> The audio captured by the microphone is <strong>never</strong> transmitted to, uploaded to, or stored on any external servers. We do not listen to, view, or share your live environment audio.</li>
        <li><strong>Immediate Discard:</strong> Once the audio is analyzed for a trigger event, the data is immediately discarded from memory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. User Recordings & Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The App allows you to record your own voice to be played back to your pet automatically.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> Your voice recordings are stored locally within the App’s sandbox on your device. These files are accessible only by the App and are not shared with any third parties or uploaded to any cloud storage managed by us.</li>
        <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You maintain full control over these recordings and can delete or re-record them at any time through the App's interface.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services (Analytics Only)</h2>
    <p>We do not use any third-party advertising services. We may use limited analytics services solely for the purpose of improving app stability:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Used strictly for crash reporting (Crashlytics) and anonymous usage analytics to help us identify and fix bugs. This service <strong>does not have access</strong> to your microphone or voice recordings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We prioritize the security of your local data. Since your voice recordings and audio processing remain on your device, they are protected by the standard security protocols of the iOS operating system.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Given our offline-first approach for audio, no child's voice data is collected or transmitted by us.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
