    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: January 2026</p>
    
    <p>Welcome to <strong>PetCalm</strong>. By downloading or using the App, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Purpose and Usage</h2>
    <p>PetCalm is designed as an automated interaction tool for pet owners. It allows the user to record their voice and plays it back automatically when specific sounds (e.g., barking) are detected.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Entertainment Purpose Only:</strong> This App is intended for entertainment and comfort purposes only. It is <strong>not</strong> a substitute for professional pet care, training, or supervision.</li>
        <li><strong>Not a Safety Device:</strong> You should not rely on the App as a safety monitor for your pet. We are not responsible for your pet's behavior or well-being while using the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. User Content & Local Storage</h2>
    <p>You retain full ownership of the audio recordings you create within the App.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You grant the App a limited license to process and play these recordings locally on your device solely for the purpose of the App's functionality.</li>
        <li>Since we do not upload your recordings to a server, you are responsible for backing up your data if you delete the App or change devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Device Performance & Battery</h2>
    <p>The App requires continuous microphone usage and audio processing to function properly ("Always Listening" mode while active).</p>
    <p>Please be aware that this functionality may consume significant battery power. We recommend keeping your device connected to a power source during extended use. We are not liable for any issues resulting from battery drainage.</p>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights of any nature in the App (excluding your personal recordings) together with the underlying software code are owned directly by us.</p>

    <h2>5. Prohibited Activities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You are not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the App.</li>
        <li>You must not use the App to harass others or for any illegal purpose.</li>
        <li>You generally agree to use the App in a way that does not cause distress to your pet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not contain third-party advertisements. We use limited third-party services for technical stability only. By using PetCalm, you also agree to be bound by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase Terms of Service</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available". We do not guarantee that the audio detection will be 100% accurate or that it will trigger correctly every single time. Factors such as background noise, distance, and microphone quality can affect performance.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from your use of the App, including but not limited to the failure of the App to soothe your pet.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update our Terms of Use from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>
